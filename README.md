# Introduction

`sqlitemaker` is a tool for converting csv data to sqlite databases. It is 
written in [Python][python] using ugly hacks with some [SQLAlchemy][sqlalchemy] 
ORM-sauce sprinkled on top. 

This is an old tool I wrote while learning how to write python (perhaps my first
complete python project). I've recently tried my hand at a rewrite so that the 
code is a little less embarassing, but I'm sure there are still some laughable 
hacks and other ugly corners, but it _does_ work. I still this quite often in my 
daily analytical work, and for many more tasks than I originally intended. YMMV.

To see the man-style help documentation, simply run `python sqlitemaker.py -h`
